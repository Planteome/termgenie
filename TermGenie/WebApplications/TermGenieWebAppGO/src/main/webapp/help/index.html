<h2>When to use TermGenie - Decision Tree</h2>
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_decision_tree.png" alt="Decision tree"/></div>

<h2>Permanent Identifiers</h2>
Every term that is requested through TermGenie receives a stable and permanent Gene Ontology ID.
All requests are reviewed by a gatekeeper, a GO ontology editor, before being made public.  
The majority of classes are approved upon review but, occasionally, classes may be rejected.
In the latter case, the class will still be preserved in the ontology file as an obsolete 
class, which should not be used for annotation.

<h2>Step By Step Tutorial</h2>
<ol>
<li>Click ‘Log-in’ at top right of page at 
<a href="http://go.termgenie.org/">http://go.termgenie.org/</a><br/> 
(If you already are a registered user, you can skip the step number 3).</li>

<li>Create or use your a browser log-in by selecting BrowserID and clicking 
on ‘Log In’ using your email address; you will then be prompted
for a password
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_002.png" alt="TermGenie login selection - screen shot"/></div>
</li>

<li> Send your user ID (your email address) to the TermGenie help desk: 
<a href="mailto:help@go.termgenie.org">help@go.termgenie.org</a> They can 
grant you permission to submit term requests.</li>

<li>Click ‘sign in’ at browser user id
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_004.png" alt="BrowserID login - screen shot"/></div>
</li>

<li>This will take you back to the TermGenie front page at the step 2 Template stage.
</li>

<li>From the tree, select the type of term you are seeking to create. It is possible to search for templates in the search box.
</li>

<li>You can add more than one of the same or a different template by 
clicking ‘Add template’ allowing the creation of many
new terms at the same time.

<div class="additional-remark"><b>NB:</b> To remove templates added in error, just click on the
'Less' button:
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_007b-more-less.png" alt="TermGenie template removal button - screen shot"/></div>
</div>
</li>

<li>Paste in the go term id or <b>type the name</b> of the term you 
are requesting a child term for.

<div class="additional-remark">At this step you can add any DB Xrefs such as a <span>PMID:1234567</span> 
or your identity (e.g., <span>GOC:yaf</span>) and again there is a
(More, Less) option to add/remove boxes.</div>
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_008.png" alt="TermGenie template input data - screen shot"/></div>
</li>

<li>Click on the ‘Verify Input’ button. This will create GO:TEMP ids, name 
and definitions for the future terms in the preview and submit page.
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_009.png" alt="TermGenie template 'Verfify Input' button - screen shot"/></div>
</li>

<li>Confirm your selection by clicking on the small tick-box on the
left of each new term. Then click ‘Submit for Review’ followed by ‘Submit’ 
(the ‘Preview’ button should change to ‘Submit’ when you tick the ‘Submit 
for Review’ check box).

<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_010b.png" alt="TermGenie template step 3 submit - screen shot"/></div>
</li>

<li>Your new term ids in the final step are created for your new GO term 
with a new GO id starting <span>GO:1900xxx</span>, which will be put into 
the OBO file within a few days after review of a senior editor, e.g.:
<pre>
  ID: GO:1900034 Label: regulation of cellular response to heat
  ID: GO:1900035 Label: negative regulation of cellular response to heat
  ID: GO:1900036 Label: positive regulation of cellular response to heat
</pre>
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_011.png" alt="TermGenie generated terms - screen shot"/></div>
</li>

<li>
You can preview the term hierarchy via a chart, with the new and updated 
terms by clicking on the ‘Generate Image button at Step 3.<br/>
This will open a new window/tab displaying a QuickGO style chart, which 
has your new term(s) incorporated.<br/> 
<b>NB:</b> The link to the images are temporary and will no longer be viable 
after 30mins. So if you need the image for longer, you need to save it. 
<div class="screen-shot"><img src="images/image_012.png" alt="TermGenie generated hierarchy preview"/></div>
</li>

<li>The new GO terms will be reviewed by a senior GO editor before they
are placed in the OBO file. When accepted, an email will be sent to you 
and the terms will become visible and available to you within a couple 
of days.</li>

<li>In the meantime you are able use the new go id in your appropriate 
editor (e.g.: protein2go, which recognizes TermGenie generated GO ids) 
&#8211; this will save time later and you won’t need to go back to a 
pending item to add the new term once it is in QuickGO or AmiGO etc.</li>

<li>Currently, once logged in, your TermGenie session will be valid for 
the duration of your browser being open. To create another set of new 
terms you can reset TermGenie to the 'Step 2: Template' page 
by refreshing the page.</li>

<li>However, if you do encounter a problem, you may have to restart the 
browser.  You may also need to do this if you get various error messages 
during various stages of TermGenie when the GO ids are being generated.<br/>
If an error persists or TermGenie is not responding at all, then please 
send an email to the TermGenie help desk: <a href="mailto:help@go.termgenie.org">help@go.termgenie.org</a></li>

  <h2>Using TermGenie for ontologies other than GO</h2>
  <p>
  The TermGenie architecture is designed to be used with any obo or owl ontology, but at the moment some detailed configuration
    may be required. You can find out more on the <a href="http://termgenie.org">TermGenie project page</a>.
